Tic-tac-toe

Please create a simple tic-tac-toe application. Your application should:
1. Give a brief welcome message to the user. Then loop through the following steps.
2. Ask the user for input:
	2.1 Input must be coordination on the tic-tac-toe board. You can define how this coordination should be mapped to the spaces on board.
	2.2 Input must be validated. For example, if you use (x,y) coordination, the input must be from 0,0 to 2,2.
	2.3 First input belongs to Player 1 (X), second input belongs to Player 2 (O), third input Player 1 (X) again, and so on and so forth.
3. Display the tic-tac-toe board. It should consists of X, O, or blank space. Columns are separated by | and rows are separated by -
4. Check if the player wins. If the player wins or it has been the ninth step, exit out of the loop.
5. Print out the result: Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or Draw.

A sample interface will be:
