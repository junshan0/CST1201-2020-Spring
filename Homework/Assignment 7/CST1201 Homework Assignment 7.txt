CST1201 Homework Assignment 7

Note: For this homework, the following must be followed:

1. Proper indentation and usage of curly braces
2. Input, output, and processing logic must be grouped properly into their own blocks and separated using empty lines.
3. Detailed comments on what you try to do for each code block.
4. Each result number must be calculated using a independent method.
5. Each method must have proper method comments, including @param and @return

Q1: Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Write an application that will: 
1. allow users to input an N, 
2. call a method fib() which returns an array of Fibonacci sequence, up to the Nth occurrence, and
3. print out the array.

For example, if the user inputs 7, the output should be:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Q2: Sequential search
Generate a String array of 50 US states' postal abbreviation (e.g., NY, NJ, CA). Allow user to input a string and search the string in the state abbreviation array. If found, print out "It is a valid state abbreviation!". If not, print out "It is NOT a valid state abbreviation!".

Q3: Selection sort and binary search
Create a solution for Q2, but sort the array first, and use binary search.

Q4: 2D Array
Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array of int initialized with test data. The program should have the following methods:
• getRowTotal. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The method should return the total of the values in the specified row.
• getColumnTotal. This method should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a column in the array. The method should return the total of the values in the specified column.
