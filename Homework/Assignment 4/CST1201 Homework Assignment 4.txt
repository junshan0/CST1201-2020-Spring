CST1201 Homework Assignment 4

13. File Head Display

Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file. The program should display only
the first five lines of the file’s contents. If the file contains fewer than five lines, it should
display the file’s entire contents.

15. Uppercase File Converter

Write a program that asks the user for the names of two files. The first file should be opened
for reading and the second file should be opened for writing. The program should read
the contents of the first file, change all characters to uppercase, and store the results in the
second file. The second file will be a copy of the first file, except that all the characters will
be uppercase. Use Notepad or another text editor to create a simple file that can be used
to test the program.
